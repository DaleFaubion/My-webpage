              Collaborated with a partner to learn the basics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
              Our goal was to create a device to provide a service to students across campus. To
              accomplish this, we decided to build a device that would allow students to see how
              quiet study spaces around campus were, deciding where to go study based on the readings
              accessed via a website. We were able to create the device, gather decibel readings from
              a room, and push those readings to an Amazon Web Services database via the MQTT client.
              We were unable to finish the website to pull readings from the device due to time constraints,
              but were able to learn how to use MQTT to communicate with IoT devices and a bit about
              how IoT devices work.
